# Weather-App

My first weather app uses this [Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com). Once allowed the app uses the gps coordinates given by the browser to find the weather in your area. The data provided is your region, country, temperature, weather conditions description, and weather icons. 

Clicking on the temperature lets you convert between fahrenheit and celsius. Use the randomizer button to quickly tour the weather experienced by others all around the world. Use the home button to ground you back home.
